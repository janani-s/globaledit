# Martian Robots

###Design
1. A board class which keeps track of robots. The board class also validates if a position is out of bounds, tracks robot scent, and moves the robots around.
2. A robot class which keeps track of the current position and direction of the robot. 

###Assumptions
The starting coordinates are valid

###Estimation
To build out the full solution for a customer (from design to final product) would take at most 2 days (16 hours). 

The final product would:
1. Include better encapsulation - there would be proper access modifier specification
1. Involve more testing and include all relevant unit tests.
2. Include better edge case handling
3. Possible optimation
4. Better input/output capabilities

If the final product is to involve the display and movement of robots on a board, then I would estimate that to take at most a week. I have not used graphics in java so that will include the learning curve.
